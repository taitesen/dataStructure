--- TEST INPUT FILES ---
The program can read a character of only 100 length per lines.
So we need to take measures on the length of each lines that is about to be feed on to the program.
Every instance of a line in a file must not exceed a length of 100 characters
Now, given that every lines do not exceed a maximum of 100 characters, the program is going to print
the lines which are longer than 80 chactacters.
Meaning some lines need to exceed a length of 80 characters in order to find out
if the program works or not.

Note: some lines are exactly 99 and 100. Watch carefull how they behaves
Tweak the define values of MAXLEN so see what happens
